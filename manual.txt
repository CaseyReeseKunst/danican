NAME
       danican - International draughts.

SYNOPSIS
       danican [ -ssize ] [ filename ]

DESCRIPTION
       The  X-Window  program Danican lets you play international
       draughts. This game is slightly  different  from  the  one
       known as draughts in UK and checkers in US. Mainly:

       * Board is 10x10 instead of 8x8.

       * A man may capture backwards.

       * Majority capture precedes.

       * A king is a long-range piece.

       This  software was named Danican in tribute to F.-A. Dani-
       can-Philidor, most famous chess and draughts player of the
       18th century.

   Option
       -s     Sets  the size in pixel of one square of the board.

   Notes
       Players can be both human; one human, one  computer;  both
       computer. If a player is set to computer, one has to click
       on the board to let it start playing. If both players  are
       computer, one has to click on the board at each move.

       Danican allows to save and load games using a limited ver-
       sion of PDN (Portable Draughts Notation).   For  now,  the
       program is unable to handle genuine PDN files.
