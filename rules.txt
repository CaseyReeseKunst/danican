* The game is played on the dark squares of a 10x10 checkered board. From the
players' point of view, the bottom-left square is a dark one.

* There are 20 white men and 20 black men. At start, they lie on the players'
four nearest ranks.

* Players move in turn. White begins.

* If a player has no legal move he loses the game.

* A man moves one square diagonally forward, provided this place is vacant.

* If a man ends its move on the last rank, it promotes to king.

* A king moves one or several squares, along a diagonal line, forwards or
backwards, provided the entire path is empty.

* If next to a man, forwards or backwards, is a square occupied by an
opponent's piece, then the man captures the piece by jumping over it to the
square immediately beyond, provided this place is vacant.

* If the man can proceed in a similar way in another direction, except the
opposite, it must do so, taking care to follow the path that brings the
maximum number of captured pieces (regardless to their kind). If there's more
than one way to meet this condition, the player is free to choose.

* If a king sees, at any distance, an opponent's piece and immediately beyond
one or more subsequent vacant squares, it captures by jumping the piece and
landing on one of these squares.
      
* A king is subject to the same rules regarding majority capture than a man.

* Capture is compulsory.

* If a man, in the course of a multiple capture, visits a square of the last
rank without ending its move on it, it does not promote.

* In case of a multiple capture, the captured pieces are removed from play
only after it has taken its complete course.

* In the course of a multiple capture a piece may visit the same square more
than once, but it may not capture the same piece twice.
